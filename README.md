# Android Studio

I made two apps from Android Studio. One is people counter, the other is weekly to-do list. I made them because the apps online have lots of junk or ads. It is better to make something more personal.

People counter is to count how many people in an event. By pressing "+1" and "0", we can use the app to get an acurate number.

weekly to-do list is to write down something the most important for the week. Everyday has a task to complete or memorize.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
